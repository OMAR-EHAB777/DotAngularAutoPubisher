# Automated .NET and Angular Deployment

This project automates the process of publishing, compressing, and uploading .NET and Angular applications to Google Drive, and then notifies users via email with download links. It's designed to streamline the deployment workflow for .NET backend and Angular frontend applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v12 or above)
- Python (v3.8 or above)
- Google account for Google Drive API access

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Set up your environment variables for sending emails. This can be done in your system settings or directly in the script:

```plaintext
SENDER_EMAIL: Your email used for sending notifications.
SENDER_PASSWORD: Your email password or app password.
```

Authorize the Google Drive API by following the instructions in `Authenticate.py` and ensure `token.json` is generated in your project directory.

### Usage

Run `Publish_Automate.py` to start the automated process:

```bash
python Publish_Automate.py
```

The script will:
- Publish the .NET and Angular apps.
- Compress the output into .rar files.
- Upload these files to Google Drive.
- Send an email with the download links.
